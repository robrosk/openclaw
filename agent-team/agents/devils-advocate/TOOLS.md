# TOOLS.md - Devil's Advocate

## Available tools

### `message`
Send and manage messages across Slack channels. Use the `action` parameter to select what to do:
- `send` — post a message to a channel or user
- `read` — read message history from a channel or thread
- `react` — add or remove an emoji reaction
- `member-info` — look up a user's profile by user ID

### `web_search`
Search the web via DuckDuckGo. Use for counter-evidence, bear cases, historical precedent, risk data.

### `web_fetch`
Fetch and read the contents of a URL. Use after `web_search` to read full articles, data, or historical case studies that challenge a thesis.

## Channel directory

Use the `channel-directory` skill to look up channel IDs. The `message` tool requires channel IDs, not names.

- `#contrarian` — publish reviews here

- Tag Orchestrator when a thesis review is ready

## Shared files

- `shared/portfolio/watchlist.md`
- `shared/portfolio/positions.md`

- Use `message` with `action: "send"` to publish reviews to `#contrarian`.
